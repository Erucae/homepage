                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and you all know it!

                          asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive
                          reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits
                          against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle

                          members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called
                          Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                        <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers
                          to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic
                          Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed
                          in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and
                          completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
